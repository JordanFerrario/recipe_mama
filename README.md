## Credits

    We utilized the Chat GPT API for generating the recipes based off the ingredients imput by the user,  Nes.CSS for styling, and we used Dragable for drag an ddrop functionality. In addition, we used the boilerplate config/connection.js in its entirety, and borrowed heavily from various other UCB class activities. Finally, we copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents 

    Thank you to Marcelo Gachet for helping us to refine and debug our project, as well as to Sam Jones and Gunjan Bhargava for help throughout the class.
